# Closures

Closures in Rust bear similarities to lambda functions found in other programming languages. They offer a concise means to create short blocks of functionality within code. Closures, like functions, can capture and manipulate variables from their enclosing scope. They are defined using the `|argument| { body }` syntax, where `argument` represents parameters and `body` signifies the functionality of the closure.

Write a closure to calculate the area of a circle and another to print out the area.
